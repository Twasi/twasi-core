## Contents
Twasi-Core is the main application. It can be started and will then automatically create the initial folder structure and config files. After that, you have to adapt those files and install all the plugins you need. After that, you can start it again. It will connect to the configured MongoDB server, load all plugins in the 'plugins' directory and start the webinterface.

These features are beeing implemented or planned into twasi-core. See the feature-plugin list for a complete list of options:
- Reliable, simple and small API for plugins
- Multilanguage (In first place English and German. For other languages is community support needed)
- WebAPI interface where you can control the bot over the network (e.g. an online panel) and register new users without asking them for their Twitch OAuth token.

## Compile from source
Twasi-Core is a java maven application. Just issue `mvn clean compile assembly:single` to generate your jar file. Copy it to an own directory (it will create some files) and issue `java -jar TwasiCore-1.0-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar` in it. It will fail to start (no connection to database), but create a config file (twasi.yml). Edit the config files and adapt all values to your needs. Learn [here](https://github.com/Twasi/twasi-core/blob/master/docs/DATABASE.MD) how to set up and initialize the database. Learn [here](https://github.com/Twasi/twasi-core/blob/master/docs/TWITCH_OAUTH_SETUP.MD) how to set up the authentication with Twitch to use the /auth endpoint.

## Download precompiled version
